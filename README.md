Project website constructor in clear JavaScript.
For style I've used bootstrap and my own styles.

OOP was applied in practice and principles of solid. Deploy of the application to the Farbase hosting.

In the process of coding, several tasks were solved to improve and optimize the code: from static HTML to dynamically adding blocks using JS classes.

In the constructor, you can add the title and text of a new post or informative block yourself. With the ability to set the style for each of the parts of this block.
